![Cover Image](GitHub_cover_image/telemedicine.jpg)

## Overview
This project addresses the pressing need to optimize telemedicine services in Portuguese hospitals by utilizing a decade's worth of historical telemedicine data. Our research question explores how this data can be used to predict follow-up consultations and thus improve resource allocation, staffing, and scheduling within these healthcare services.

## Research Question
How has historical telemedicine data, over the past decade, contributed to predicting follow-up consultations at Portuguese hospitals and optimizing staffing, scheduling, and geographical resource allocation to enhance telemedicine services?

## Project Goal
The aim is to develop a predictive model that uses historical telemedicine data to forecast the volume of follow-up consultations in Portuguese hospitals. This model will assist in making informed decisions regarding staffing, scheduling, and resource distribution, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of telemedicine services.
