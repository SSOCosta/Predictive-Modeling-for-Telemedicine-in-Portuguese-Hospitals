# Predictive Modeling for Telemedicine in Portuguese Hospitals
![Cover Image](GitHub_cover_image/Predictiv_ Modeling_for_Telemedicine_in_Portuguese_Hospitals/telemedicine.jpg)

## Overview
This project addresses the pressing need to optimize telemedicine services in Portuguese hospitals by utilizing a decade's worth of historical telemedicine data. Our research question explores how this data can be used to predict follow-up consultations and thus improve resource allocation, staffing, and scheduling within these healthcare services.

## Research Question
How has historical telemedicine data, over the past decade, contributed to predicting follow-up consultations at Portuguese hospitals and optimizing staffing, scheduling, and geographical resource allocation to enhance telemedicine services?

## Project Goal
The aim is to develop a predictive model that uses historical telemedicine data to forecast the volume of follow-up consultations in Portuguese hospitals. This model will assist in making informed decisions regarding staffing, scheduling, and resource distribution, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of telemedicine services.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. The project also requires Jupyter Notebook to view and run the notebook file.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SSOCosta/Telemedicine-in-Portugal.git

```
### Navigate to the Project Directory
```bash
cd telemedicine-portugal
```

### Install Required Libraries
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

Launch Jupyter Notebook to access the project:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to Telemedicine in Portugal over the years.ipynb and run the cells to execute the analysis and view the model's performance.
